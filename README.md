# React Fundamental Concepts I Used

Components: The building blocks of the application, used to create reusable UI elements.

JSX: A syntax extension used to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM.

State Management: Utilized the useState hook to manage component state.

Lifecycle Methods: Used hooks like useEffect to handle side effects and component lifecycle events.

Props: Passed data between components using props to create dynamic and reusable components.

# Data Handling and Management

For handling and managing data, I used:

Context API

Local Storage

# Key Features  

Dynamic Dashboard: A user-friendly dashboard that displays and manages the user's cart and wishlist.

Real-time Notifications: Toast notifications to inform users of actions like adding items to the cart, removing items, and sorting items.

Product Sorting: Allows users to sort their cart items by price, providing a streamlined shopping experience.

Persistent Data: Data in the cart and wishlist are saved in local storage, so users don‚Äôt lose their selections upon page refresh.
